# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to disect PyBer ride data. We used ride sharing data PyBer has collected to analyze trends in areas such as city type (rural, suburuban, or urban), amount of drivers in a city, amount of rides in a city, and the amount (sum) of fares in a city. Our goal was to discover trends to see if any city market is being overlooked or underlooked, so that we as a company can capitalize and maximize profit.

Results:

  Rides in each city type:

Here you can see that there is the most rides in Urban cities and the least in rural cities. This makes sense as there is a larger population in these areas.

This trend continues for total drivers and total fares:
