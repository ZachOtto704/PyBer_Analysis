# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to disect PyBer ride data. We used ride sharing data PyBer has collected to analyze trends in areas such as city type (rural, suburuban, or urban), amount of drivers in a city, amount of rides in a city, and the amount (sum) of fares in a city. Our goal was to discover trends to see if any city market is being overlooked or underlooked, so that we as a company can capitalize and maximize profit.

Results:

Let's go into the differences in ride-sharing data that we found among different city types. First looking at the amount of rides for each city type.
  
  Rides in each city type:

Here you can see that there is the most rides in Urban cities and the least in rural cities. This makes sense as there is a larger population in these areas.

This trend continues for total drivers and total fares:

Here you can see that a large majority of our profit is coming from Urban and Suburban cities. 

Next we'll look at some trends for the average amount of fare per ride based on city type and average fare per driver based on how many drivers are in a specific city.

Avg. Fare per Ride Based on City Type:

Avg. Fare per Driver Based on City Type:

Here we can see that the less drivers and rides in a city, the more expensive the ride will be. And oppositely the more drivers and amount of rides that are in a city, the less expensive a ride will be. This seems to be a simple result of supply and demand for rides.

Summary:

Above is the final summary table we created. If we want to address disparities among cities and city types, we should look at the demand for rides in cities. One might look at our summary table and think that rural communities as being overlooked by PyBer and that more funding should go to these areas. However these rural cities might simply use less ride sharing services. It might be better to drill deeper into the data in suburban and urban cities, and see if there are any specific cities that are far below similar population cities in terms of ride usage. These cities may be under represented by Oyber and could use more drivers in the area. It would be interesting unclassify city types, and simply compare population data to PyBer usage and see those results.
